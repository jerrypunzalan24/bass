  <h2>Advice:</h2>
  <h5>Don't fight back</h5>
  <p>Don't hit the bullies - you might end up being accused of bullying yourself</p>
  <h5>Tell someone</h5>
  <p>When youâ€™re ready to tell someone, it might help to write down what you want to say first or put it in a letter. Try and choose a person you feel comfortable with and who you think you can trust. If the abuse is happening at home, you might want to talk to somebody outside of the family such as a teacher or doctor. Find out more about asking an adult for help.</p>
