  <h2>Advice:</h2>
  <h5>Leaving the scars behind</h5>
  <p>Overcoming bullying can be one of the hardest things to do. We often speak to adults who bear the scars of bullying and it has affected their adulthood in one way or another. They may have trust issues, low self-esteem and self-worth.</p>
  <h5>Finding the strength</h5>
  <p>If you are dealing with the aftermath of bullying, you could be feeling drained and low on batteries. Trying to find the strength to understand, process and overcome what you have experienced might feel like the hardest thing to do</p>
  <h5>It's not me it's you</h5>
  <p> If you can try to visualise the experience but look at the situation from an outsiderâ€™s perspective, this can help you see how the person who was bullying you was perhaps motivated by their own reasons and actually you never were to blame or responsible for what you had to go through. Bullies often have very low self-esteem and low self-worth and will bully others to try and compensate for their own negative emotions.</p>
  <h5>Accepting your emotions</h5>
  <p>It is natural under the circumstances to feel a mixture of emotions. You may be feeling sad, anxious and very low or possibly you may be feeling angry and violated. As a result of the bullying, you could be feeling depressed and want to withdraw from the world.</p>
